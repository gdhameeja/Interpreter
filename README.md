# Pascal Interpreter
Interpreter is a computer program that reads the source code written in a particular language and executes the instructions.
On the other hand compiler is a computer program that converts the source code written in one language into a lower level language which can then be run to execute the instructions.

## Language of implementation:
Java

Based on book by Ronal Mak


### My understanding
- Compiler has two ends - frontend and a backend.
- Frontend does the initial translation and syntax checking etc.
- Frontend consists of Parser, Scanner, Source and Token.
- Parser controls the frontend execution.
- Parser calls scanner methods to get next token and/or current token.
- Scanner tokenizes the the source program.
- Source represents the source program.
